ABO12221	Participates in a pentose oxidation pathway that  converts D-arabinonate to 2-oxoglutarate.  {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16849334}.	This family consists of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase,  or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and it also includes  HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase from E. coli strain W.    FAA is the last enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, it hydrolyses  fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate which then join the  citric acid cycle [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. Mutations in FAA cause type I tyrosinemia in humans this is an inherited disorder mainly affecting the liver leading to  liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal tubular damages and  neurologic crises amongst other symptoms [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. The enzymatic defect causes the toxic accumulation of phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolites [<a href="#ref3">3</a>]. The E. coli W enzyme HHDD isomerase/OPET decarboxylase contains two copies of this domain and functions in fourth and fifth steps of the homoprotocatechuate pathway; here it decarboxylates OPET to HHDD and isomerises this to OHED.  The final products of this pathway are pyruvic acid and succinic  semialdehyde. This family also includes various hydratases and 4-oxalocrotonate  decarboxylases which are involved in the bacterial meta-cleavage  pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds. 2-hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase encoded by mhpD in E. coli <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/entry/P77608">P77608</a> is involved in the phenylpropionic acid pathway of E. coli and catalyses the conversion of 2-hydroxy pentadienoate to 4-hydroxy-2-keto-pentanoate and uses a Mn2+ co-factor [<a href="#ref5">5</a>].
